        The set of supported modes varies per environment. (And some

        - rgb_array: Return an numpy.ndarray with shape (x, y, 3),
          representing RGB values for an x-by-y pixel image, suitable
          for turning into a video.
        - ansi: Return a string (str) or StringIO.StringIO containing a
          terminal-style text representation. The text can include newlines
          and ANSI escape sequences (e.g. for colors).

            Make sure that your class's metadata 'render.modes' key includes
              the list of supported modes. It's recommended to call super()
